        <h4>It's a Dog's Life</h4>
        <p>
          Dog Obedience Training is good for you and your dog. Your dog is your
          companion and a member of your family, it is worth taking the time to
          learn how to better communicate with them. With consistent practice
          and the proper techniques you can establish the foundation for an
          obedient dog, which makes for a happy home.
        </p>

          Paula Mckenzie has been working with dogs for over 50 years. She has
          done it all, from breeding to showing, grooming to training and
          everything in between. She has taught numerous people how to work with
          their dogs, starting with beginners level all the way to advanced.

        <h4>What To Expect</h4>
        <p>
          We will meet once a week for one hour of class time. The class lasts
          for 8 weeks. You will need to practice with your dog for at least 30
          minutes per day outside of class. The final class you and your dog
          will be tested to show standards. Once you have completed the class,
          you need to continue working with your dog every day, keep on
          practicing. You truly get out what you put into it.

        <h4>What You Will Learn</h4>
        <p>
          We will start with some basic obedience commands and practice working
          with our dogs to reinforce these skills throughout the class.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Heel</li>
          <li>Sit</li>
          <li>Stay</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That will be our foundation, and we will build on that as we progress,
          yet always coming back to these basics. Short, frequent training
          sessions throughout the week are highly recommended.
        </p>

        <h4>What You Need for Class</h4>
        <p>There are some basic supplies you will need for this class.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pinch Collar</li>
          <li>A 3ft lead</li>
          <li>Comfortable clothing and shoes</li>
          <li>Treats</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Don't worry, we will go over these items during the first class, Paula
          will show you how to get a properly fitted collar. We will be walking
          and moving the entire class, so you should dress comfortably and be
          prepared to move.
